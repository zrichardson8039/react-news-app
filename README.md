## Server Scripts

In the server directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the server, which services GET requests at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) that include **keyword** and **sort** query parameters.

## Client Scripts

In the client directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
